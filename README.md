# Int-V => A Simplified Autonomous Driving System
Intelligent Vehicle and Autonomous Driving Project

Implements:
1. High Level Planning
    - Perception Action Maps => Traffic Light
    - RRT => Obstacle Avoidance
2. Low Level Planning
    - Longitudinal Controller - PID Control
    - Lateral Controller - Preview point controller

This project contains implementations in the two folders which originate from the following repositories:
1. [**basic_agent_st**](https://bitbucket.org/tonegas/basic_agent_st/src/master/)
1. [**PyDrivingSim**](https://github.com/tonegas/PyDrivingSim)

# OBJECTIVES

The vehicle in this project is assumed as **not** driving close to *max performance*
therefore to track reference trajectory (path + speed profile) computed by a *high-level
planner*. Vehicle control tasks are decomposed in two separate tasks ***path tracking***
and ***speed profile tracking***.

The two objectives of this project are:
1. Manage traffic lights i.e. *STOP* or *PASS*
2. Avoid obstacles defined by cones in simulation environment

## Traffic Light Management
### High Level Planning

***Perception-Action Map*** is employed as high-level planner [HLP] to compute the *minimum jerk* and determine the speed profile.

### Low Level Planning

A ***Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)*** controller is implemented for the low-level planner, imposed on the vehicle to follow the speed profile generated by the high-level planner.

## Obstacle Avoidance

### High Level Planning

***Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)*** algorithm is implemented for the route planning to avoid obstacles represented by cones in the simulation environment.

Additionally, **moving average** is implemented on the points generated by the RRT and **linear regression** is used to determine the line representing the instantaneous path from the points from RRT.

### Low Level Planning

***Preview point*** lateral controller steers the vehicle to follow the path generated by the RRT route planner.
